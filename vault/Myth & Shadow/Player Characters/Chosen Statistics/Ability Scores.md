Ability scores can be improved every time a PC [Levels Up](../Derived%20Statistics/Level.md#Level%20Up).

*Ability scores are added to d20 rolls in appropriate circumstances. Common circumstances are spelled out on that ability scores rules text. The referee may also call for a particular ability roll given the situation. These ability scores are the primary way your character is mechanically represented in the game, and changing these is the primary way you can see your character progress.*
