# Experience Points

Experience Points ([XP](Experience%20Points.md)) represents the PCs progression throughout the game. 

The referee announces when a PC gets [XP](Experience%20Points.md). It is recommended each PC in the group gets the same number of [XP](Experience%20Points.md) in a session.

How the referee awards [XP](Experience%20Points.md) is up to them (objectives achieved, coins retrieved, monsters killed) all can work well.

# Referee [XP](Experience%20Points.md) Methods

## Classic Method (Campaign Games)

#### General Rules for Gaining XP

* All PCs in the party gain [XP](Experience%20Points.md) together.
* A PC *can* [Level Up](Level.md#Level%20Up) when they have
  * [XP](Experience%20Points.md) = 10 x Current PC [Level](Level.md) 
    * After they [Level Up](Level.md#Level%20Up), a PCs [XP](Experience%20Points.md) resets to 0

### Treasure XP

#### Normal Treasure

* A normal treasure is 1 [XP](Experience%20Points.md).
  * Any mundane item that is worth at least 1000 coins is a normal treasure.
  * Any magical item that is worth strictly less than 1000 coins is a normal treasure.

#### Rare Treasure

* A rare treasure is 3 [XP](Experience%20Points.md).
  * Most magical treasure is considered a rare treasure. 
    * (1000-25000 coins roughly speaking)

#### Mythic Treasure

* A mythic treasure is 10 [XP](Experience%20Points.md).
  * Any magical treasure that is especially powerful (25000+) is a mythic treasure.
    * Generally, there is at most 1 mythic treasure reward per quest / dungeon.
    * *"'What?' cried Gimli, started out his silence. 'A corslet of Moria-silver? That was a kingly gift!"*
  * A hoard of rare treasures counts as a mythic treasure, rather than each treasure needing to be accounted for individually.

### Combat XP

* Defeated magical monsters grant [XP](Experience%20Points.md) equal to half their [Level](Level.md), rounded down.
  * A Monster's stat block states whether a creature is mundane or magical.
  * *If converting from another system:*
    * *NPCs from an [Ancestry](../Ancenstries/Ancestry.md) are not considered magical.*
    * *Creatures that have ever existed on Earth are not magical.* 

### Narrative Explanation

PCs get [XP](Experience%20Points.md) by being around and absorbing magic. This is what allows them to gain [Abilities](../Chosen%20Statistics/Ability%20Scores.md) so much faster than, say, a wizard studying alone in their tower getting no new items. Making your own spell scrolls or potions does not count as finding magic items, you already have that magic.

## Session Method (Character Games)

This optional [XP](Experience%20Points.md) rule is as follows. It is better suited for less lethal games.

* The referee awards 1-5 [XP](Experience%20Points.md) at the end of the session based on how successful the party was that session, however this campaign defines success. 
  * [XP](Experience%20Points.md) rewards of 3 or 4 should be how much a competent group usually gets. 
  * 5 [XP](Experience%20Points.md) is reserved for especially impactful sessions 
  * 1 [XP](Experience%20Points.md) is reserved for the party's worst defeats. 
  * This allows flexibility of what success for a given party looks like and puts the referee and players on the same page for how close they are to leveling up. 
  * This also removes any fuss over minor [XP](Experience%20Points.md) squabbles since it happens at the end of the session and is easily calculated.
* PCs level up at 10 [XP](Experience%20Points.md) and resets to 0.
* [XP](Experience%20Points.md) should get harder to acquire as PCs get to higher levels.
* [Levels](Level.md) 5 and up may require PCs to complete a 'quest' to [Level Up](Level.md#Level%20Up).

There is an argument to be made that we learn more from our failures than our successes. While this is true, the behavior a game rewards is the behavior a game encourages, and we don't want the PCs to be trying to fail, it makes for a bad story and a bad game.

*Authors Note:*
*Carousing / training rules are not included for the following reasons. If players can spend money to get [XP](Experience%20Points.md), they will always do so, unless there is a powerful item they can buy that is as good a rate as leveling up is. If you don’t want to stock magic item shops and prepare to do shopping every level up, then this will likely never be the case with mundane items. Gating [XP](Experience%20Points.md) behind spending money makes the players desperate to spend their money, and they will not want to save up for things.*

*I prefer to run carousing more free flow and unpredictably rather than a defined system to keep the feel of it being wild, rather than spend money for [XP](Experience%20Points.md). Random tables that result in gaining / losing resources with a negative EV are my recommendation. There is a potential benefit, but a large downside too. So it’s not just a free money / [XP](Experience%20Points.md) generator.*
