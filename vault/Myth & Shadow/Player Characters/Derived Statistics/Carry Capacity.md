# Carry Capacity

This game uses an [Item Slot](Item%20Slots.md) system (think Minecraft). An item slot is an abstracted unit of weight / space combined for ease of inventory management. 

A PC with an [Adventurer's Pack](../../Items/Equipment/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Gear/100%20Coins/Adventurer's%20Pack.md) has 10 [Item Slots](Item%20Slots.md). 

If a PC wishes to carry more than can fit in their pack, then they can get a cart, wagon, horse, or similar item. See [Standard Gear](../../Items/Equipment/Standard%20Gear.md). 

Worn items such as clothing and [Armor](../../Items/Equipment/Armor.md) do not take up any slots. [Weapons](../../Items/Equipment/Weapons.md) and ammo do.

* The sheathes for your weapons and quivers for your ammo become part of your pack.

## Attempting to Overcarry

A PC can use a [Hand Cart](../../Items/Equipment/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Gear/25%20Coins/Hand%20Cart.md) to gain an additional 10 item slots.

### BUT I NEED TO CARRY THIS THING

A PC can choose to put their weapons and shield away to carry a single box-like item up to (5 + [Constitution](../Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md)) [Item Slots](Item%20Slots.md) in weight / size. While carrying this box, they are [Surprised](../../Conditions/Surprised.md) if [Combat](../../Game%20Procedures/Combat.md) starts.

* You can carry this box for a number of delve [Rounds](../../Game%20Procedures/Round.md) equal to twice your [Constitution](../Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md).
  * After that you gain the [Exhausted](../../Conditions/Exhausted.md) condition, and cannot carry any more extra stuff.
