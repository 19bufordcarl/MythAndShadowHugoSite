# Level

A PC's level represents how experienced and powerful they are. It starts at 1 and increases whenever you reach the threshold [Experience Points](Experience%20Points.md). You can then [Level Up](Level.md#Level%20Up).

## Level Up

By default, levelling up requires 1 month of [Downtime](Level.md#Downtime) where the PCs are not adventuring, but reflecting on what they have experienced thus far and honing their abilities.

When you level up, you can increase 3 different [Ability Scores](../Chosen%20Statistics/Ability%20Scores.md) by 1 each, or 1 ability score by 2.

* *Don't forget to adjust any relevant derived statistics!*

## Downtime

Activities that state they can be done over a month of downtime can be done while leveling up. 

## Max Level

By default, 10 is the max level for a PC. By that point, a PCs story should be done.

## NPCs Level

NPCs and monsters also have levels, but they are simply defined in their stat block.

## Fast Leveling

*Optional Rule: Not Recommended*
You can level up over a [Full Rest](../../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md#Full%20Rest) rather than 1 month of [Downtime](Level.md#Downtime).

Some referees and players may prefer faster level for campaigns that involve time pressure, or as just a stylistic preference. For these campaigns, it is recommended that the group comes up with a narrative reason for why the party is able to grow so quickly relative to the rest of the world.
