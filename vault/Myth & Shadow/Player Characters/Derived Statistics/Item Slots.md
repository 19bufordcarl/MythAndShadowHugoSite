# Item Slot

An item slot is used as the unit of abstraction of [Carry Weight](Carry%20Capacity.md) for the purpose of making managing inventory streamlined and enjoyable for gameplay. 

An item slot is something that either 

1. Weighs around 5 pounds **OR** 
1. Is about as big as a bicycle helmet 

Smaller items of the same thing can be bundled together into 1 slot. The common examples are

1. 2 days of rations
1. 10 of certain [Gear](../../Items/Equipment/Standard%20Gear.md) (iron spikes, candles, etc.)
1. 20 pieces of most ammunition (arrows, bolts, sling stones, etc.)
1. 500 [Coins](../../Economy/Coins.md) 
   1. (Number of slots rounds down, so 0-500 takes up 0 slots)
1. 500 coins worth of [Mythril](../../Magic/Mythril.md) powder 
   1. (Number of slots rounds down, so 0-500 takes up 0 slots)

*The goal of the system is to preserve verisimilitude of how much stuff PCs can reasonably have on them, as well as provide opportunities for decisions with clear costs. Example: Do I carry an additional torch into the dungeon or a shield?*
