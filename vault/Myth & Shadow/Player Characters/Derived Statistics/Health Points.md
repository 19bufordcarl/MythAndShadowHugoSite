# Health Points

##### Your max HP is equal to 10 + your [Constitution](../Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md)

Health Points (HP) represent your physical health. When your HP is reduced to 0, you start [Dying](../../Conditions/Dying.md).

When you take damage, you reduce [Fatigue Points](Fatigue%20Points.md) before you reduce HP.

When your FP is reduced to 0, any excess damage is dealt to your HP.

HP regenerates slowly, after a [Full Rest](../../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md#Full%20Rest), you can restore 1 HP.

## Scars

If you ever take 5 or more damage to your HP from a single hit, you incur a [Scar](Scars.md).
Each scar you have reduces your [Constitution](../Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md) by 1.

## Object HP

Inanimate objects can be given an HP value to represent how hard they are to destroy.
