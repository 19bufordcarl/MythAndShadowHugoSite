# Fatigue Points

##### Your max FP is equal to [Level](Level.md) + ([Constitution](../Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md) x 2)

Fatigue Points (FP) represent your pool of combat experience, endurance, and skill. When you take damage, you reduce any FP you have before you reduce your [Health Points](Health%20Points.md) (HP). 

When your FP is reduced to 0, any excess damage is dealt to your HP. 

FP regenerates quickly, PCs can use a [Delve Round](../../Game%20Procedures/Round.md#Delve%20Round) (6 minutes) to [Recover](../../Game%20Procedures/Delving.md#Recover) 1d4+[Constitution](../Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md) FP.

After a [Short Rest](../../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md#Short%20Rest) (1 hour) for you can restore all your FP (no rolling required).

*Fatigue points cannot be negative. If your FP would be negative, your FP is simply 0.*
