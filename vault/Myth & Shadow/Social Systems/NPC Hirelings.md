# NPC Labor Cost and Availability

If the players wish to hire NPCs, the following information applies. Hirable NPCs are still quite risk averse. They will not venture into areas affected by the [Shadowcurse](../Hazards/Shadowcurse.md) or similar danger.

When in danger, hirelings must make [Morale](Morale%20System.md) [Checks](../Game%20Procedures/Check.md).

## Commoners

1 days worth of labor is 1 coin. The additional risk increases their cost to 2 coins. Commoners will not enter any area affected by the [Shadowcurse](../Hazards/Shadowcurse.md), or similar danger level. Commoners have 1d8 [HP](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md), [Level](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) 0 and have a score of 0 for all [Ability Scores](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Ability%20Scores.md). Their only starting equipment is an [Adventurer's Pack](../Items/Equipment/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Gear/100%20Coins/Adventurer's%20Pack.md). They do not gain XP or levels.

Posting job notices to canvas a location takes a full day of effort, and only yields new NPCs once per month. You find a number of willing commoners according to the table. 

|Number of Willing Commoners|Location|
|---------------------------|-------:|
|1d6 + [Charisma](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Charisma.md)|Village (100s)|
|3d6 + [Charisma](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Charisma.md)|Town (1,000s)|
|3d6 x [Charisma](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Charisma.md)|City (10,000s)|
|3d6 x [Charisma](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Charisma.md) x 10|Capitol (100,000+)|

## Mercenaries

Mercenaries know more of the dangers of the world and come equipped with a [Delver's Kit](../Items/Equipment/Delver's%20Kit.md), [Light](../Magic/Spells/Mythril%20Spells/Level%201/Light.md) [Armor](../Items/Equipment/Armor.md), [Steel Shield](../Items/Equipment/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Armors/Mundane%20Armors/Steel%20Shield.md), and a random [Weapon](../Items/Equipment/Weapons.md). They understand danger and fighting more. They have 3 points amongst [Strength](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md), [Dexterity](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md), and [Constitution](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md), and a base of 10 HP. They are still level 0 and do not gain XP or levels. To venture with you, they want 5 coins per day. They will not venture into areas affected by the [Shadowcurse](../Hazards/Shadowcurse.md), or similar danger. Searching a location for mercenaries takes a full day, and new mercenaries become available.

|Number of Available Mercenaries|Location|
|-------------------------------|-------:|
|1d4|Village (100s)|
|2d4|Town (1,000s)|
|2d12|City (10,000s)|
|2d12x10|Capitol (100,000+)|

## Specialty

Generally, hiring specialists is not considered to be part of standard gameplay. This is part of [Stronghold](../Economy/Detailed%20Prices/Relevant%20Prices/Strongholds.md) play. And may not be desirable for all campaigns. In order to attract hiring a specialists, the PCs will need to have their own at least small keep.
