# Morale

Morale is the system to handle when NPCs will attempt to flee or surrender. 

## Breaking Points

Breaking points are situations in [Combat](../Game%20Procedures/Combat.md) that trigger a morale [Check](../Game%20Procedures/Check.md). The default are:

* A solo monster (or NPC) going below half HP
* A group losing half their members
* A group losing their leader ([Unconscious](../Conditions/Unconscious.md) or [Dying / Dead](../Conditions/Dying.md) counts as losing)

## Enemy Morale

When a breaking point occurs, the referee makes a [DC](../Game%20Procedures/DC.md) 15 [Wisdom](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Wisdom.md) [Check](../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) for the creature or the enemy leader. On a failure, the *whole group's* morale is broken.

On a failed morale check, the enemies will go into life preservation mode. They should first try to flee, if they deem that impossible or unlikely then they may attempt surrender. Particularly sly enemies may feign surrender until the party provides a vulnerable opening.

## Ally Morale ([NPC Hirelings](NPC%20Hirelings.md))

When the party undergoes a breaking point, if any [NPC Hirelings](NPC%20Hirelings.md) are present, a PC must make a [Charisma](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Charisma.md) [Check](../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) with a [DC](../Game%20Procedures/DC.md) equal to 10 + (2 x [Level](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) of the enemy creature / leader). On a failure, all the NPCs with the party have their morale broken. These NPCs will cease fighting and attempt to flee or surrender.
