# Surprised

Creatures are considered surprised if they were unaware of *all* hostile creatures when they began engaging them in [Combat](../Game%20Procedures/Combat.md). The referee determines surprise before [Initiative](../Game%20Procedures/Initiative.md) is rolled.

A surprised creature cannot use [Actions](../Game%20Procedures/Action.md) or [Movement](../Game%20Procedures/Movement.md), they can only use [Reactions](../Game%20Procedures/Reaction.md).

By default, [Surprised](Surprised.md) is removed from a creature at the end of a [Round](../Game%20Procedures/Round.md) of [Combat](../Game%20Procedures/Combat.md). 

* Usually this is the first round, unless the creature joined midway through a combat and was surprised
