# Blinded

When blinded, you canâ€™t see and automatically fail any [Check](../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) requiring sight.

Attack [Checks](../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) against you have [Advantage](../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Advantage.md), and your attack rolls have [Disadvantage](../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Disadvantage.md).
