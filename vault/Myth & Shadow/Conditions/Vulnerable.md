# Vulnerable

* If you are vulnerable to a [Damage Type](../Damage%20Types/!Damage%20Types.md) you take double damage from that damage type.
* If that damage requires you to make a [Check](../Game%20Procedures/Check.md), you have [Disadvantage](../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Disadvantage.md) on that check.
