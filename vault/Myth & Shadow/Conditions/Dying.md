# Dying

## Turns Until Death Counter

When you start dying, you roll a d4 and add your [Constitution](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md). This number is your 'turns until death counter'. You [Die](Dying.md#Dead) after that many [Turns](../Game%20Procedures/Turn.md). This result has a minimum of 1 turn.

*By default, all NPCs have a counter of 0, and thus die immediately upon hitting 0 [HP](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md).*

## Death Saves

At the start of each of your subsequent turns, roll a d20. 

* On a natural 20 you regain consciousness with 1 [HP](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md) and gain the [Exhausted](Exhausted.md) condition.
* Otherwise, you decrease your [Turns Until Death Counter](Dying.md#Turns%20Until%20Death%20Counter) by 1. 
  * When this counter reaches 0, you [Die](Dying.md#Dead). 
* *Ex. I start dying and I roll a 1 on my d4 and have 0 CON. On my turn I roll a 14. My 'turns until death counter' becomes 0. I die right there. I do not pass go. I do not collect $200.* 

## While Dying

While you are dying, the following is true

* You are [Unconscious](Unconscious.md).
* You gain the [Exhausted](Exhausted.md) condition.
* An ally can [Stabilize](Stabilized.md) you as an [Action](../Game%20Procedures/Action.md) with a [DC](../Game%20Procedures/DC.md) 15 [Intelligence](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) [Check](../Game%20Procedures/Check.md).
* If your [HP](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md) is restored 1 or more by means other than [Stabilization](Stabilized.md),
  * You wake up and are no longer [Unconscious](Unconscious.md).
  * *You are still [Exhausted](Exhausted.md) unless otherwise specified*

## Dead

When a creature's [Turns Until Death Counter](Dying.md#Turns%20Until%20Death%20Counter) reaches 0 it dies.

Dead PCs are retired from play into the hall of fame (or infamy).
