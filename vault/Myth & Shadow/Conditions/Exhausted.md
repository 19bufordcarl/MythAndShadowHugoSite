# Exhausted

If you are exhausted, your [Fatigue Points](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md) are set to 0 and cannot be restored.

Any damage you take while exhausted causes you to fall [Unconscious](Unconscious.md).

The [Exhausted](Exhausted.md) condition is removed after a [Long Rest](../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md#Long%20Rest).
