# Spell Memorization

A PC can memorize a number of [Spells](Spells.md) equal to 2 times the PCs [Intelligence](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) stat.

|Intelligence|Max number of spells memorized|
|------------|------------------------------|
|1|2|
|2|4|
|3|6|
|4|8|
|5|10|
|6|12|
|7|14|
|8|16|
|9|18|
|10|20|
|Through [Spell Scrolls](Spell%20Scrolls.md), PCs can 'store' spells beyond what they can memorize.||

*Arcane knowledge is fickle, complex, and hard to retain. It takes a mental toll to remember spells for mages and [Spellcasting](Spellcasting.md) is tiring.*

## Memorizing New Spells (Learning)

PCs do not automatically learn [Spells](Spells.md) at [Level Up](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md#Level%20Up). They must learn using the following methods.

### Finding Spell Scrolls

A PC can attempt to [Learn New Spells From Spell Scrolls](Spell%20Scrolls.md#Learning%20From%20Spell%20Scrolls).

### Self Study

PCs can learn [Spells](Spells.md) with [Spell Level](Spell%20Level.md) less than or equal to their [Max Spell Level](Spell%20Level.md#Max%20Spell%20Level) when they [Level Up](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md#Level%20Up).

In order to learn a spell this way, the PC must spend 10x the amount of [Mythril](Mythril.md) powder required to [Cast](Spellcasting.md) that spell experimenting. Then they roll a d20. On a natural 1, they suffer two [Critical Miscast](../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Critical%20Miscast.md) effects

#### Self Study Memorization Limit

A PC cannot exceed their [Spell Memorization](Spell%20Memorization.md) limit when learning [Spells](Spells.md) this way.

* You cannot just 'forget' spells.
  * A spell can only be forgotten when it is forced out of your brain when [Memorizing Another Spell From A Scroll](Spell%20Scrolls.md#Spell%20Scroll%20Memorization).
* You can still find or procure spell scrolls using one of the other two methods once you are at your memorization limit.

*Spells are a fickle thing to understand, they take up part of your very being. They are nearly impossible to explain to another being, and when another spell takes that place in your being, it's like it changes a part of you. You can only faintly recall memories of casting the forgotten spell.*

### Apprentice Study

If a PC does not have memory for spells left at [Level Up](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md#Level%20Up), they can still learn [Spells](Spells.md) using this method by studying with a teacher to [Make a Spell Scroll](Spell%20Scrolls.md#Making%20Spell%20Scrolls) for any [Spells](Spells.md) they wish to learn.

* This spell counts as being scribed by the PC.

This is a riskless, albeit slow, way to learn new spells.

#### Arcane Study

The default setting has spell learning through the [Arcane Guild](../Economy/Detailed%20Prices/Relevant%20Prices/Arcane%20Guild.md) to facilitate this over [Downtime](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md#Downtime).

* *Per Imperial Law, the Guild only teaches spells to initiated members in good standing.*
* *Per Imperial Law, the Guild does not teach any [Spells](Spells.md) associated with the [Death](Spell%20Domains/Death.md) domain.*
* *Per Imperial Law, the Guild does not teach any [Spells 4th Level](Spell%20Level.md) or higher, except to those with a letter of recommendation from a Chapter Archmage.*

#### Temple Study

The default setting also has spell learning through [Temple Services](../Economy/Detailed%20Prices/Relevant%20Prices/Temple%20Services.md) to facilitate this over [Downtime](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md#Downtime).

* *Per Imperial Law, Temples may only teach spells to initiated members in good standing.*
* *Per Imperial Law, only Temples whose deity is associated with the [Life](Spell%20Domains/Life.md) domain may teaches spells.*
* *Per Imperial Law, Temples may not teach any [Spells 4th Level](Spell%20Level.md) or higher.*

Temples only teach spells who have a [Domain](Spell%20Domains/!Domain%20Index.md) associated with their deity.
