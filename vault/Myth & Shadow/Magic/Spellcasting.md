# Spellcasting

Mortals cannot use magic innately. Magic is fickle, ancient, and poorly understood. Hence why it is called magic. [Spells](Spells.md) are channeled though [Mythril](Mythril.md) powder or magic items. You can only attempt to cast spells that you have [Memorized](Spell%20Memorization.md).

## The Spellcasting Roll

To successfully cast a [Spell](Spells.md), you must make an [Intelligence](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) [Check](../Game%20Procedures/Check.md).

* The [DC](../Game%20Procedures/DC.md) is equal to 10 + (2 x the [Spell's Level](Spell%20Level.md)).
* On a failed [Check](../Game%20Procedures/Check.md), the spell fizzles, any [Mythril](Mythril.md) powder is still consumed.
* On a [Critically Failure](../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Critical%20Failure.md) a [Critical Miscast](../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Critical%20Miscast.md) occurs.
* On a [Critical Success](../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Critical%20Success.md) a [Critical Cast](../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Critical%20Cast.md) occurs.

### Material Cost

Casting [Spells](Spells.md) consumes [Mythril](Mythril.md) powder corresponding to the [Spell's Level](Spell%20Level.md).

## Casting Time

Spell casting takes time, specified on the spell card under “Casting”. (Ex. [Alarm](Spells/Mythril%20Spells/Level%201/Alarm.md) takes 1 [Action](../Game%20Procedures/Action.md)).

*Reminder, assume [Combat Actions](../Game%20Procedures/Action.md#Combat%20Action), [Delving Actions](../Game%20Procedures/Action.md#Delving%20Action) will say 6 minutes.*

#### Interruption

Spells with a casting time of longer than 6 minutes can be interrupted. The caster may choose to interrupt their own casting. If the caster takes damage, they must make a [DC](../Game%20Procedures/DC.md) 25 [Wisdom](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Wisdom.md) [Check](../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) or be forcibly interrupted.

If a spell cast is interrupted, willing or unwilling, a [Critical Miscast](../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Critical%20Miscast.md) occurs.

## Duration

All [Spells](Spells.md) have a specified duration. The spell's effect lasts for the duration.

* A [Spell](Spells.md) with a duration of "None", like [Fireball](Spells/Mythril%20Spells/Level%203/Fireball.md), simply apply their effect once and then end.
* Some [Spells](Spells.md) require [Concentration](Concentration.md) for their duration to continue.

## Casting Movement and Noise

Spellcasting requires ***two free hands*** for complex hand movements. You must speak an otherworldly incantation whose sound booms with arcane energy unless otherwise noted. 

## Spell Range

[Spells](Spells.md) that shoot projectiles at a target do not require a separate [Ranged Attack](../Game%20Procedures/Ranged%20Attack.md), that is part of what [The Spellcasting Roll](Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll) is doing. You must be able to see (or touch) the target of your spell.

Touch spells can only be cast on creatures whom you could make a [Melee Attack](../Game%20Procedures/Melee%20Attack.md) against.

[Spells](Spells.md) with an area of effect (AOE) apply relevant spell text to all creatures in that area.

## Upcast

If you want to make a spell more powerful, you can use an amount of [Mythril](Mythril.md) powder required to cast a higher [Spell Level](Spell%20Level.md), and gain the upcast benefits listed in the spell text. The [Spell Level](Spell%20Level.md) is treated as whatever you upcasted it to for the purposes of [The Spellcasting Roll](Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll).

The level at which you upcast a spell cannot exceed your [Maximum Spell Level](Spell%20Level.md#Max%20Spell%20Level).

## Blood Magic

If you fail [The Spellcasting Roll](Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll), you may choose to succeed it instead as long as it wasn't a [Miscast](../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Critical%20Miscast.md).

* If you do, sacrifice [FP](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md) equal to the difference between [The Spellcasting Roll](Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll) and the [DC](../Game%20Procedures/DC.md).
* If this reduces your [FP](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md) to 0, you gain the [Exhausted](../Conditions/Exhausted.md) condition, and then take any of the remaining difference as damage to your [HP](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md).

*Remember the [Rule for rules](../Foreword/Rule%20for%20rules.md).*
