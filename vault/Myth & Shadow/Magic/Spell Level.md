# Spell Level

Different spells have different power levels, known as spell levels. Typically, a [Spell](Spells.md) of certain level is accessible to a Caster according to the following rules.

## Max Spell Level

|Sum of [Intelligence](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) and [Wisdom](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Wisdom.md)|Max Spell Level|
|------------------------------|---------------|
|1-4|[1st Level Spells](Spells/Mythril%20Spells/Level%201/1st%20Level%20Spells.md)|
|5-8|[2nd Level Spells](Spells/Mythril%20Spells/Level%202/2nd%20Level%20Spells.md)|
|9-12|[3rd Level Spells](Spells/Mythril%20Spells/Level%203/3rd%20Level%20Spells.md)|
|13-16|4th Level|
|17-20|5th Level|
|21+|Mythic|

A PCs maximum spell level spell level is equal to one quarter of the sum of caster's [Intelligence](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) and [Wisdom](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Wisdom.md) rounded up.

* For all you math folks:
* Max Spell Level $= \lceil($Caster [Intelligence](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) + Caster [Wisdom](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Wisdom.md)$)/4\rceil$

You can only upcast spells to a level less than or equal to your max level.

*Author's Note:*
*These two types of 'level' is a somewhat unfortunate naming scheme inherited from historical RPGs. It is more mental effort to change this language than deal with it in my opinion.*
