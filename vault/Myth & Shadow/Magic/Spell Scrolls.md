# Spell Scrolls

[Spell Scrolls](Spell%20Scrolls.md) are created by mages using [Mythril](Mythril.md) infused ink. Mages will usually put this individual pages together in a [Spell Book](../Items/Equipment/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Gear/100%20Coins/Blank%20Book.md), but they can be loose.

Spell scrolls can act as a kind of storage for any spells the PC comes across but does not have the mental space to [Memorize](Spell%20Memorization.md), and can also be used to [Cast Spells](Spell%20Scrolls.md#Casting%20Spell%20Scrolls) directly in a pinch.

## Making Spell Scrolls

A PC can scribe [Spells](Spells.md) onto a [Spell Scroll](Spell%20Scrolls.md).

In order to scribe a spell this way, you must scribe it in [Mythril](Mythril.md) ink. [Mythril](Mythril.md) ink is made by putting an amount of Mythril powder equal to the casting cost of the spell into normal ink. 

* The powder diffuses unnaturally well into the ink.
  
  * Once in the ink, the [Mythril](Mythril.md) does not take up any item slots, but cannot be used to cast spells directly anymore, only for scribing.
* A single stroke of the pen into the Mythril ink absorbs all the Mythril ink at once, the pen is then ready to scribe a spell, for the learned mage.
  
  * It take 6 minutes (1 delve [Round](../Game%20Procedures/Round.md)) to scribe 1 spell this way.
  * Hardly any of the mundane ink is actually used, the rest of the ink goes back to normal.

### Spell Scroll Memorization

During a [Short Rest](../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md#Short%20Rest), you can memorize any number of spells you have scribed in spell scrolls. These new spells force any memorized spells you do not want out of your brain to make sure you don't exceed your [Spell Memorization](Spell%20Memorization.md) limit.

*This effectively lets you swap out spells with those you have scribed. Be careful not to forget any spells which you have not scribed yet, lest you have to relearn them from scratch!*

#### Interruption

If spell scroll memorization is [Interrupted](../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md#Interruption), you must stop memorizing to engage in combat. If you stop this process, a random spell you were memorizing is forgotten and it's ink is destroyed.

## Using Spell Scrolls

Each mind has their own way of understanding and scribing a spell. 

### Learning From Spell Scrolls

Trying to [Memorizing New Spells](Spell%20Memorization.md#Memorizing%20New%20Spells%20(Learning)) from a scroll you did not scribe requires [A Spellcasting Roll](Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll) and takes 1 hour *per spell*. This can be done on a [Short Rest](../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md#Short%20Rest).

* On a failure, the page disintegrates, roll on the [Miscast Table](Miscast%20Tables/!Miscast%20Tables.md).
  * If [Interrupted](../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md#Interruption), you must stop this process if you want to engage in combat.
  * If you stop, roll on the [Miscast Table](Miscast%20Tables/!Miscast%20Tables.md).
* On a success, you learn the spell, and the inked scroll remains intact.
  * You must choose a spell you have memorized to 'forget'.

### Casting Spell Scrolls

Alternatively, you can attempt to [Cast](Spellcasting.md) a [Spell](Spells.md) from a scroll directly, bypassing the [Spellcasting](Spellcasting.md) need for [Memorization](Spell%20Memorization.md). Doing so destroys the ink on the scroll.

* Make [A Spellcasting Roll](Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll) as if you were casting the spell normally.
  * If it is of a higher [Spell Level](Spell%20Level.md) than your [Max Spell Level](Spell%20Level.md#Max%20Spell%20Level), make the [Check](../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) at [Disadvantage](../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Disadvantage.md).
* On a failure, the page disintegrates.
  * If you did not scribe the spell, you also roll on the [Miscast Table](Miscast%20Tables/!Miscast%20Tables.md).
