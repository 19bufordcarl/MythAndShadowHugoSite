# Mythril

Mythril is the single most important resource in the world. It is only through Mythril that magic can be channeled into the world, and almost all [Spellcasting](Spellcasting.md) consumes Mythril powder. 

## Mythril Resource Cost

Unless noted otherwise, a spell consumes Mythril powder according to the follow table to cast.

|Spell Level|Price of Mythril Powder (in silver coins)|
|-----------|-----------------------------------------|
|1|10|
|2|25|
|3|100|
|4|250|
|5|1000|
|Mages are known to carry pouches of Mythril powder. 500 coins worth of Mythril powder can fit into a pouch that takes up one [Item Slot](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Item%20Slots.md).||

* This creates a one-to-one slot correspondence between coins and Mythril powder
* This means they can be counted together in your coin pouch in your [Adventurer's Pack](../Items/Equipment/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Gear/100%20Coins/Adventurer's%20Pack.md).

Mythril [Coins](../Economy/Coins.md#Imperial%20Currency%20and%20Availability) are 100 coins worth of powder condensed and melted into a single coin. Powerful mages carry Mythril coins to cast higher level spells so they don't lug around bags of powder.

* The spellcasting process disincorporates it back into powder for any unused amount.
