# Alchemy

Alchemy is the foundation of modern magical understanding. All alchemical understanding points towards the following general recipe for successful potion brewing.

## Brewing Procedure

Potion brewing requires 

1. A sterile container, usually a glass bottle
1. Twice the [Mythril](../Mythril.md) required to cast that spell
1. Purified water (usually through an alchemical apparatus to achieve purification) 
1. Make [The Spellcasting Roll](../Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll) for that [Spell](../Spells.md).
   1. Add any bonuses / penalties from your apparatus.
1. On a success, you have successfully brewed a potion of that spell! 
   1. The brewing process generally takes 1 hour succeed or fail. 
   1. A failure consumes all materials still and yields bad water.
   1. Brewing can be done over a [Long Rest](../../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md#Long%20Rest).
1. Potions retain the ranges of their [Spells](../Spells.md) as follows (unless otherwise augmented). 
   1. Self: Liquid must be drunk
   1. Touch/Target: The liquid must touch the target or be drunk
   1. AOE: Explodes in the radius when the bottle is uncorked / broken
1. When the potion is drunk / opened, the [Spell](../Spells.md) takes effect. 
   1. You don't make an additional [Spellcasting Roll](../Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll).
   1. If the [Spell](../Spells.md) text references [The Spellcasting Roll](../Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll), treat it as the minimum roll required for that spell.
      1. Which is (10 + (2 x [Spell Level](../Spell%20Level.md)))

As a general rule of thumb, effectively all (>99%) of the liquid in a potion must be consumed / coat the target in order for a 'critical mass' of liquid to bind the magical effect. 

Small tastes can give clues to the effect of a potion, without imbibing the full affect. 

Potions cannot be split / shared, unless of course they are AOE in which case everyone in the radius incurs the full effect. 

## Harvesting Ingredients

*Optional Rule: (Not recommended)*
*A monster part from the associated domain of that spell reduces the spellcasting check required equal to the level of the monster from which the part was harvested.* 

*Monsters have a number of harvestable parts equal to their level.*

*Only one monster part can be used per potion brewed.*

*Optional Rule: Harvester - Extreme*
*Same as the harvester variant, with the following addition.*

*Using monster parts add a random effect based on the level of the monster part. When the potion is used (not made), roll on the [Alchemy Table](Alchemy%20Table.md) to see what the effect is. Some are good, others bad!*
