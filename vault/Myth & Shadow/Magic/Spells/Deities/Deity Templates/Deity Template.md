# Deity

**You must have at least X AbilityScore to follow Deity.**

## Deity's Boons

### Altered Spellcasting

For [Spells](../../../Spells.md) that share one of [Deity's Domains](Deity%20Template.md#Deity's%20Domains):

* You use AbilityScore in place of [Intelligence](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) for [The Spellcasting Roll](../../../Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll).
* You use AbilityScore in place of [Intelligence](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) if referenced in the spell text.
* You use AbilityScore in place of [Intelligence](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) for determining [Max Spell Memorization](../../../Spell%20Memorization.md).
* You use AbilityScore and [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) in place of [Intelligence](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) and [Wisdom](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Wisdom.md) for determining your [Maximum Spell Level](../../../Spell%20Level.md#Max%20Spell%20Level).

### Unique Boon

For life domain deities

### Deity's Domains

* Element(s)
* Energy(s)

## Deity's Banes

### Limited Spells

You cannot memorize or cast spells that do not share one of [Deity's Domains](Deity%20Template.md#Deity's%20Domains).

### Heresy

Leaving Deity's faith grants you the cursed =feature= of a heretic.

* Your AbilityScore becomes -3 until you find a way to break the curse.
* Should only apply to death domain deities
