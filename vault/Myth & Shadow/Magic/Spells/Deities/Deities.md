# Deities

A PC can swear faith to a Deity at [Character Creation](../../../Character%20Creation/Character%20Creation%20Walkthrough.md), or over [Downtime](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md#Downtime) by visiting a [Temple](../../../Economy/Detailed%20Prices/Relevant%20Prices/Temple%20Services.md) that worships that Deity.

Deities grant their followers an altered connection to the spiritual and magical, augmenting their [Spellcasting](../../Spellcasting.md) abilities. The exact effect is determined by the Deity worshipped.

A creature can only be bound to the faith of a single Deity at a time.

## Lore

*The deities of the world of Myth and Shadow are fickle and ancient. The good ([Life](../../Spell%20Domains/Life.md) domain) deities' influence is hardly felt in modern times. While no respectable scholar would outright deny their existence, there are certainly those who question their exact "divine" nature. Many theories exist as to whether or not ancient myths are to be trusted and the gods used to be more involved, or if they are merely tall tales of pseudo-history* 

*The evil ([Death](../../Spell%20Domains/Death.md) domain) deities, colloquially know as Demons, influence is much more direct in the modern world. Their legions of cultist and unholy monsters are a constant threat to all mortals. They very likely the cause of the [Shadowcurse](../../../Hazards/Shadowcurse.md). Their followers build hidden blasphemous temples, and these traitorous heretics have admitted to conversing with these foul Demons directly. They are invariably tempted by the evil powers, no doubt. The Arcane Guild and Imperial Temple are united in resisting the threat of necromancy, and oppose it at all costs.*

*There are some dubious accounts of outright "miracles" being performed through the grace of a good gods, but this is not widely accepted by the arcane community. There are certainly healing rituals performed at temples across the Empire for her peoples, but these rituals are studiable magicks, using standard Mythril techniques. The priests swear that their rituals and prayer teaches them how to weave the magic more effectively, and the High Imperial Archpriest can call me a heretic all he likes, so long as I oppose necromancy we are united where it counts. I believe these "rituals" are nothing more than Mythril at work. The gods ability to impact the mortal realm has simply gone unsubstantiated for far too long.*

## Referee Specific

For certain campaigns, it may be inappropriate to have PCs start as a follower of a deity, simply make sure you alert your players of this prior to character creation

See the [Deity Template](Deity%20Templates/Deity%20Template.md) for the default Deity rules and if you wish to make your own.
