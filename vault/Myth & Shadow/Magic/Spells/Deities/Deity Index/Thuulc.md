Leaving Thuulc's faith grants you the cursed madness of a heretic.

## Thuulc's Ethos

Thuulc, demon of the deep. While his chief domain is [Water](../../../Spell%20Domains/Water.md), he is the hoarder of all forbidden and arcane knowledge, and grants his followers abilities to glimpse the un-glimpseable.

Many a mage have been tempted by the draw of the forbidden knowledge that Thuulc offers. There is some knowledge that the [Arcane Guild](../../../../Economy/Detailed%20Prices/Relevant%20Prices/Arcane%20Guild.md) has banned for reason, and you should let sleeping dogs lie, lest the great beast of the deep wrap his tentacles around your mind.
