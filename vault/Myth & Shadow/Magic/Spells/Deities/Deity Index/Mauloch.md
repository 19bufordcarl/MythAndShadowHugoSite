### Altered Spellcasting

For [Spells](../../../Spells.md) that share one of [Mauloch's Domains](Mauloch.md#Mauloch's%20Domains):

* You use [Charisma](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Charisma.md) in place of [Intelligence](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) for [The Spellcasting Roll](../../../Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll).
* You use [Charisma](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Charisma.md) in place of [Intelligence](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) if referenced in the spell text.
* You use [Charisma](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Charisma.md) in place of [Intelligence](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) for determining [Max Spell Memorization](../../../Spell%20Memorization.md).
* You use [Charisma](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Charisma.md) and [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) in place of [Intelligence](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) and [Wisdom](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Wisdom.md) for determining your [Maximum Spell Level](../../../Spell%20Level.md#Max%20Spell%20Level).

### Death Comes For Us All

### Mauloch's Domains

* [Fire](../../../Spell%20Domains/Fire.md)
* [Death](../../../Spell%20Domains/Death.md)

## Mauloch's Banes

### Limited Spells

You cannot memorize or cast spells that do not share one of [Mauloch's Domains](Mauloch.md#Mauloch's%20Domains).

### Heresy

Leaving Mauloch's faith grants you the cursed heart of a heretic.

* Your [Constitution](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md) becomes -3 until you find a way to break the curse.

## Mauloch's Ethos

Hellfire and destruction. Mauloch's followers seek to destroy the living and send their souls for him to feed on in his realm of brimstone and fire. In return he grants them powers untold.
