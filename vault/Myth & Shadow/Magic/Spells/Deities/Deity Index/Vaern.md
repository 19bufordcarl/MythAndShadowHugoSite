For [Spells](../../../Spells.md) that share one of [Vaern's Domains](Vaern.md#Vaern's%20Domains):

* You use [Charisma](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Charisma.md) in place of [Intelligence](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) for [The Spellcasting Roll](../../../Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll).
* You use [Charisma](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Charisma.md) in place of [Intelligence](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) if referenced in the spell text.
* You use [Charisma](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Charisma.md) in place of [Intelligence](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) for determining [Max Spell Memorization](../../../Spell%20Memorization.md).
* You use [Charisma](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Charisma.md) and [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) in place of [Intelligence](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) and [Wisdom](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Wisdom.md) for determining your [Maximum Spell Level](../../../Spell%20Level.md#Max%20Spell%20Level).

### Heresy

Leaving Vaern's faith grants you the cursed lethargy of a heretic.

The web weaver, the prince of darkness, deceit, and undeath. The malevolent vampires acknowledge Vaern as the font of their power, and the arcane community believes Vaern to be the most serious threat to civilization. Manipulations rules in his realm. Vaern is proof the pen is mightier than the sword.
