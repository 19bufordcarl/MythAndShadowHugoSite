## Gaera's Ethos

Goddess of the Earth. Symbolized by loyalty, faith, and stalwart character. Patron of the faithful, and those who defend their allies. The [Orcs](../../../../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/Orcs.md) are most appreciative of Gaera's rituals, who have taught them how to live in the mountains, mine their riches, and work their stones.
