# Holy Circle

|Level|[3rd Level Spell](../../../Spell%20Level.md)|
|-----|---------------|
|Casting|1 [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Action.md)|
|Duration|1 minute ([Concentration](../../../Concentration.md))|
|Range|Self, AOE|
|Domains|[Life](../../../Spell%20Domains/Life.md)|

You create a 10 foot radius of holy aura around you.

Creatures and any [Spells](../../../Spells.md) associated with the [Death](../../../Spell%20Domains/Death.md) [Domain](../../../Spell%20Domains/!Domain%20Index.md) cannot enter the circle. If you move within 10 feet of them, they are magically pushed back, so they always remain just outside of the circle.

Any creatures that are level 5 or higher can make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/DC.md) 16 [Wisdom](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Wisdom.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) once per [Round](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Round.md) to resist this spell.

*Upcast: Increase the DC by 2 per spell level.*
