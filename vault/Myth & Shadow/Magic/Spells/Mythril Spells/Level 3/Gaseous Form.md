You have your form and gear turn into a cloud of mist.

Your movement speed becomes 300 feet, you can move with all 6 degrees of freedom in 3-d space, and you can squeeze through any spaces that mist could seep into.

You are aware of your surroundings, but cannot interact with the world in any meaningful way, and cannot [Cast Spells](../../../Spellcasting.md) while transformed.

* This means you can neither deal nor take damage.

You can end the form at any time you wish.

*Upcast: No effect.*
