You creature an illusion of a size up to a 30 foot cube within range.

Any creature who can see the illusion is considered affected by it.

Any affected creature chooses whether to suffer an effect you proposed or be frozen with fear ([Incapacitated](../../../../Conditions/Incapacitated.md)) for the duration.

If the creature is [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) 3 or higher, they can make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/DC.md) 16 [Wisdom](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Wisdom.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) to resist this spell.

If any of the affected creatures touch the illusion, the spell immediately ends. 

Think of this spell like a super [Maneuver](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Maneuver.md).

*Upcast: Increase the DC by 2 per spell level.*
