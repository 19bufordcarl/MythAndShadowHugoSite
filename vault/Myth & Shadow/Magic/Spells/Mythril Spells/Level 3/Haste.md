You touch a creature and imbue it with magical speed.

The creature gains a +5 bonus to their [Dexterity](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md).

When this spell ends, the creature is [Incapacitated](../../../../Conditions/Incapacitated.md) for its next [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Turn.md) as it becomes lethargic.

If you cast this spell on an unwilling target, the can make a DC 16 wisdom check to resist this spell

*Upcast: Increase the dexterity bonus by 1 and the DC by 2 per spell level*
