# Magic Missile

|Level|1st [Level Spell](../../../Spell%20Level.md)|
|-----|---------------|
|Casting|1 [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Action.md)|
|Duration|None|
|Range|120 feet|
|Domains|[Air](../../../Spell%20Domains/Air.md)|

You make this [Spellcasting](../../../Spellcasting.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) with [Advantage](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Advantage.md).

You shoot a magical bolt of energy at a target that deals 1d4 + 1 [Bludgeoning](../../../../Damage%20Types/Bludgeoning.md) or [Piercing](../../../../Damage%20Types/Piercing.md) damage. The missiles bend around corners if necessary, they always hit. 

This means you only need to be able to see a sliver of the target rather than the normal line of sight rules for [Spell Projectiles](../../../Spellcasting.md#Spell%20Range).

*Upcast: Shoot one additional missile per spell level.*
