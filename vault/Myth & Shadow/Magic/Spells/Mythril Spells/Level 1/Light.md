# Light

|Level|1st [Level Spell](../../../Spell%20Level.md)|
|-----|---------------|
|Casting|1 [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Action.md)|
|Duration|1 hour|
|Range|Touch|
|Domains|[Fire](../../../Spell%20Domains/Fire.md)|

You imbue an object with a brilliant, heatless light equivalent to a [Torch](../../../../Items/Equipment/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Gear/1%20Coin/Torch.md) for a duration of 1 hour, equivalent to 6 [Delving](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Delving.md) turns.

Alternatively, if you are within 5' of a creature, you can attempt to blind it by casting light on it's eyes. It must make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/DC.md) 12 [Wisdom](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Wisdom.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md). On a failure, it is [Blinded](../../../../Conditions/Blinded.md).

*Upcast: Increase the DC by 2 per spell level. Additionally, the light defeats higher level [Darkness](../Level%202/Darkness.md) spells at higher levels.*
