|Casting|1 [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Action.md)|
|Duration|2d4 days|
|Range|30 feet|

Your magically charm one humanoid of [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) less than or equal to your [Intelligence](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) you can see within range.

They are compelled to see you as a close friend for the duration of the spell. If the target already harbors friendly feelings toward you, they remain relatively unchanged, but will not remember you have charmed them. 

Should you or your allies engage in actions perceived as harmful by the target, the spell will abruptly end. 

Once the spell ends, the target becomes aware of the magical enchantment you placed upon them, and will very likely become hostile.

*Upcast: Increase the duration by 1 day per spell level.*
