You clap your hands together creating a sonic blast. This concussive wave deals 1d6 + 1 [Bludgeoning](../../../../Damage%20Types/Bludgeoning.md) damage to creatures within a 10 foot radius of you. Each creature must make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/DC.md) 12 [Constitution](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md). On a failure the creature is pushed back 10 feet.

Any unsecured objects are flung backwards. The thunderous clap is audible for around 300 feet.

*Upcast: Deal 1 additional damage and increase the DC by 2 per spell level.*
