You create a sphere of magical darkness with a 15' radius. 

Creatures inside this darkness are [Blinded](../../../../Conditions/Blinded.md).

Only magical light can penetrate this darkness, and only if it came from a spell whose [Level](../../../Spell%20Level.md) is greater than or equal to the [Level](../../../Spell%20Level.md) used to cast [Darkness](Darkness.md).

The target of the sphere can be a point, or an object.

*Upcast: Resists higher level magical light.*
