# Silence

|Level|2nd [Level Spell](../../../Spell%20Level.md)|
|-----|---------------|
|Casting|1 [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Action.md)|
|Duration|None|
|Range|60 feet, AOE|
|Domains|[Air](../../../Spell%20Domains/Air.md)|

You create a sphere of soundless air in a 15' radius within range. No sound can enter, leave, or be created inside the sphere, and so affected creatures are [Deafened](../../../../Conditions/Deafened.md).

*Upcast: Increase the range by 30' per spell level.*
