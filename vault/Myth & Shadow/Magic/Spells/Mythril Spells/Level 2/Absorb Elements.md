If you would take damage whose source is the one of the elemental magical [Domains](../../../Spell%20Domains/!Domain%20Index.md) [Air](../../../Spell%20Domains/Air.md), [Earth](../../../Spell%20Domains/Earth.md), [Fire](../../../../Damage%20Types/Fire.md), or [Water](../../../Spell%20Domains/Water.md), you can cast this spell to become [Resistant](../../../../Conditions/Resistant.md) to a [Damage Type](../../../../Damage%20Types/!Damage%20Types.md) of that magic.
