# Knock

|Level|2nd [Level Spell](../../../Spell%20Level.md)|
|-----|---------------|
|Casting|1 [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Action.md)|
|Duration|1 minute|
|Range|30 feet|
|Domains|[Earth](../../../Spell%20Domains/Earth.md)|

You magically open a portal (door, gate, etc.) through all mundane locks or barriers, or a [Hold Portal](../Level%201/Hold%20Portal.md) spell of a lower [Spell Level](../../../Spell%20Level.md).  This creates a thunderous 'knock' noise audible out several hundred feet.

*Upcast: Defeats higher level held portals.*
