# Detect Thoughts

|Level|2nd [Level Spell](../../../Spell%20Level.md)|
|-----|---------------|
|Casting|1 [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Action.md)|
|Duration|1 hour ([Concentration](../../../Concentration.md))|
|Range|30 feet|
|Domains|[Water](../../../Spell%20Domains/Water.md)|

For the duration, you gain the ability to peer into the mind of creatures you can see within range. 

Each [Combat](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Combat.md) [Round](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Round.md) you can learn one target's immediate thoughts. The target then makes a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/DC.md) 14 [Wisdom](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Wisdom.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md). On a success, the target notices your mental intrusion, and the spell ends.

*Upcast: Increase the DC by 2 per spell level. Additionally, the referee can give you deeper level thoughts appropriate to the higher spell level.*
