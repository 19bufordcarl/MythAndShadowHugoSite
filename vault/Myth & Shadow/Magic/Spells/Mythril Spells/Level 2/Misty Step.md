##### FAQ

Once a creature starts [Attacking](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Attack.md) you (rolls the d20), an [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Action.md) is underway and thus Reactions cannot be taken unless otherwise specified, so you cannot cast this spell to avoid damage. You can, however, cast this spell after a creature [Moves](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Movement.md) to attack you, thereby wasting it's movement.
