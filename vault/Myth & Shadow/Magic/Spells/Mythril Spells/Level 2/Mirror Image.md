# Mirror Image

|Level|2nd [Level Spell](../../../Spell%20Level.md)|
|-----|---------------|
|Casting|1 [Action](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Action.md)|
|Duration|1 minute|
|Range|30 feet|
|Domains|[Air](../../../Spell%20Domains/Air.md)|

You create illusions (images) that look exactly like you. You can create a number of images equal to half your [Intelligence](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Intelligence.md) rounded down (minimum 1). Whenever you would be dealt damage, the damage hits one of your images instead, which dissipates harmlessly. 

The spell ends once all the images are gone.

*Upcast: Create an additional image per spell level.*
