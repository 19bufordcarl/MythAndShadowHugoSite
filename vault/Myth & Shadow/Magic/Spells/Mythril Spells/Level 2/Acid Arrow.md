An especially corrosive bolt of acid shoots forth at a target you can see in range. It takes 2d4 [Acid](../../../../Damage%20Types/Acid.md) damage. 

Reduce the [Armor X Property](../../../../Items/Equipment/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Armors/Armor%20Properties/Armor%20X%20Property.md) of that creature by 1.

* If this is a [Mundane](../../../../Items/Equipment/Material%20Properties/Mundane%20Property.md) [Armor](../../../../Items/Equipment/Armor.md) set, it is permanently damaged. 
* [Silvered](../../../../Items/Equipment/Material%20Properties/Silvered%20Property.md) [Armor](../../../../Items/Equipment/Armor.md) is only damaged until the acid is washed off with water. 
* [Mythril](../../../../Items/Equipment/Material%20Properties/Mythril%20Property.md) [Armor](../../../../Items/Equipment/Armor.md) is undamaged by this spell

*Upcast: Deal an additional 1d4 damage per spell level.*
