You create a 30' cube of sticky web within range. Any creatures in the affected area must make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/DC.md) 14 [Strength](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md). 

* On a failure, they are [Restrained](../../../../Conditions/Restrained.md). 
* On a success, they break free.
