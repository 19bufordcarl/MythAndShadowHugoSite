You choose 1 target humanoid ([Ancestry](../../../../Player%20Characters/Ancenstries/Ancestry.md)) you can see within range. 

If they are [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) 4 or less, they are [Paralyzed](../../../../Conditions/Paralyzed.md). 

If they are [Level](../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) 5 or greater, they make a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/DC.md) 14 [Wisdom](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Wisdom.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) to resist this spell.

A creature [Paralyzed](../../../../Conditions/Paralyzed.md) by this spell makes a [DC](../../../../Game%20Procedures/DC.md) 14 [Wisdom](../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Wisdom.md) [Check](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) at the *end* of their [Turn](../../../../Game%20Procedures/Turn.md). On a success, the spell ends (along with the [Paralysis](../../../../Conditions/Paralyzed.md)).

*Upcast: Increase the DC by 2 per spell level.*
