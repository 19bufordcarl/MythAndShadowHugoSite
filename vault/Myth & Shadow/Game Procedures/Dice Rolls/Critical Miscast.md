# Critical Miscast

When [A Spellcasting Roll](../../Magic/Spellcasting.md#The%20Spellcasting%20Roll) is a [Critical Failure](Critical%20Failure.md), you miscast the spell. 

The spell backfires in some unexpected, usually bad, way.

* Roll for a result on the appropriate [Miscast Table](../../Magic/Miscast%20Tables/!Miscast%20Tables.md).
