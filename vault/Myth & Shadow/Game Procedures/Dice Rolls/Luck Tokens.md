# Luck Tokens (Reroll)

A PC can spend a Luck Token to reroll any [Check](../Check.md) and must use the new result.

A PC can only have 1 reroll token at a time.

Luck tokens are only given out through special abilities, typically through [Deities](../../Magic/Spells/Deities/Deities.md) blessings.

*The [Deities](../../Magic/Spells/Deities/Deities.md) of the world are fickle. Their existence isn't disputed, though the degree of their influence on the mortal realm is heavily debated. Most scholars believe it to be negligible, and couched mostly in superstition.*
