# Critical Hit

When making an [Attack](../Attack.md), if you rolled a [Critical Success](Critical%20Success.md), you can do a critical hit.

A critical hit lets you double the damage dealt from each [Damage Type](../../Damage%20Types/!Damage%20Types.md) on that attack.

##### Maths Note

* While each damage type is doubled separately, this is relevant only for the purposes of the [Resistant](../../Conditions/Resistant.md), [Vulnerable](../../Conditions/Vulnerable.md), or [Immune](../../Conditions/Immune.md) conditions.

* If none of those apply, the distributive property means that you can just add all damage types together to get the total damage and the double that.
