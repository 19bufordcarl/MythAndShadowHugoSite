# Combat

When a fight breaks out, or seconds start to matter (collapsing cave), combat [Rounds](Round.md) start.

First the referee determines if any creatures are [Surprised](../Conditions/Surprised.md).

The referee then calls for [Initiative](Initiative.md) rolls. Combat [Rounds](Round.md) persist until the danger of combat is over, usually from surrender, fleeing, or death.
