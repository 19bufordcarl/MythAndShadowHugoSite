# Resting

Resting is the main way PCs can recover damaged stats and heal conditions.

## Short Rest

A short rest is a period of 1 hour (10 delve [Rounds](Round.md)) doing next to no movement or physical activity. You regain all [Fatigue Points](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md) when you short rest.

* During this time you can do light mental activity, such as swapping [Memorized Spells](../Magic/Spell%20Memorization.md).
* You cannot do heavy mental activity like [Alchemy](../Magic/Alchemy/Alchemy.md) or [Spellcasting](../Magic/Spellcasting.md).

### Interruption

If a short rest is interrupted by [Combat](Combat.md) or similar danger, you must stop your light mental activity such as [Memorizing New Spells](../Magic/Spell%20Memorization.md#Memorizing%20New%20Spells%20(Learning)) to engage, which causes a random spell being swapped to be forgotten.

* You can choose to not engage, but if you take damage, you must succeed a [DC](DC.md) 25 [Wisdom](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Wisdom.md) [Check](Check.md) or be forcibly interrupted.

You regain [Fatigue Points](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md) as you would have normally. (Xd4 + (X times [Constitution](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md))) where X is the number of rounds into the short rest before you were interrupted.

## Long Rest

A long rest must be at least 8 hours long (2 [Watches](Watches.md)) and consumes 1 ration. After a long rest, all [Fatigue Points](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md) are restored, [Exhaustion](../Conditions/Exhausted.md) is cured, as are conditions that specify removal after a long, or full night of rest.

* You can split the rest into two pieces (at most 1 watch in between them) and still benefit.
* Long resting is necessary to avoid [Sleep Deprivation](../Hazards/Biological.md).
* You can do heavy mental activity such as [Spellcasting](../Magic/Spellcasting.md) or [Alchemy](../Magic/Alchemy/Alchemy.md) for at most 1 hour.

### Interruption

If a long rest is interrupted by [Combat](Combat.md) or similar danger, the PCs still gain the benefits of the rest provided there was only one interruption and it was less than 1 hour long.

If there were multiple interruptions, or they lasted longer than 1 hour, a PC must succeed a [DC](DC.md) 15 [Constitution](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md) check. If they fail, they only receive the benefits of a short rest.

## Full Rest

A full rest is a full day (6 [Watches](Watches.md)) spent primarily resting. A full rest confers all the benefits of a long rest. Additionally a full rest confers the following benefits.

* Restore 1 [Health Point](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md).
* Restore any temporary ability damage (not [Scars](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Scars.md)).

Additionally, many [Conditions](../Conditions/!Conditions.md) are healed / removed after a full rest.
Temporarily damaged stats are usually healed after a full rest as well.

You can do heavy mental activity such as [Spellcasting](../Magic/Spellcasting.md) or [Alchemy](../Magic/Alchemy/Alchemy.md) for at most 1 hour this day.

### Interruption

Each time a full rest is interrupted by [Combat](Combat.md) or similar danger, a PC must make a DC 15 [Constitution](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md) [Check](Check.md) to receive the benefits of the rest. On a failed check they only receive the benefits of a long rest.

Word to the wise: donâ€™t count on full resting outside of civilization.
