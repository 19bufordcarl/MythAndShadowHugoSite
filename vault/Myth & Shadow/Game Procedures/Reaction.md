# Reaction

A reaction can be taken at any time during combat when no [Action](Action.md) is occurring.

You can only take one reaction per [Round](Round.md).
Imagine you have a reaction point. It refreshes on your turn, use it or lose it.

The most common reaction is readying an [Action](Action.md).

Another common reaction is [Shield Block](../Items/Equipment/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Armors/Armor%20Properties/Shield%20Property.md#Shield%20Block).

Unless you ready them, only specified abilities and spells can be used as a reaction.
