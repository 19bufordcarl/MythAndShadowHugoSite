# Movement

On a [Turn](Turn.md) in [Combat](Combat.md), you can move up to your speed (default 30’). 

* On a grid, each square is usually 5', so this would be 6 squares. 
* In a measurement system 5' is usually 1" in real space, so this would be 6". 
* FYI (feet = ', inches = ")

Movement can be discontinuous, (i.e. move 10', [Attack](Attack.md), drink potion, move 20').

## Movement Minor Actions

You can spend 5' of movement to perform minor actions. The most used examples being:

* Drink a potion (max of 1 per [Round](Round.md))
* Stand up
* Open a door
* Lie down / Crouch
* Pull a lever
* Pick up an item

## Difficult Movement

Difficult movement costs double your movement resource. Examples include:

* Crawling
* Sneaking
* Wading
* Swimming
* Difficult Terrain
* Climbing

## Opportunity Attacks

If you are [Threatened](../Conditions/Threatened.md) by a creature, moving out of that creature’s threaten range allows that creature to use its [Reaction](Reaction.md) to make a [Melee Attack](Melee%20Attack.md) against you.

* These [Melee Attacks](Melee%20Attack.md) called opportunity attacks.

You may spend 15' of movement to not provoke opportunity attacks for that [Turn](Turn.md).

## Enemy Creatures

You cannot move through a space occupied by another creature who is unwilling to let you pass. If that creature is [Incapacitated](../Conditions/Incapacitated.md) or [Prone](../Conditions/Prone.md) you may move through its space.

## Sizes

Creatures occupy a space equal to their size. Normal size is 1 square or 5 feet. For creatures 2 sizes larger than you, (3 squares or more for normal size) you move through their space with [Difficult Movement](Movement.md#Difficult%20Movement). If you end your [Turn](Turn.md) in their occupied space, they may use their [Reaction](Reaction.md) to make an [Opportunity Attack](Movement.md#Opportunity%20Attacks) against you.

## Variable Speed

*Optional Rule: Recommend*

* PCs have a base move speed of 30'.
* Increase (or decrease) a PCs speed by 5' for each point of [Dexterity](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md) they have.
* Decrease a PCs speed by 5' times X where X is the [Strength X Property](../Items/Equipment/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Armors/Armor%20Properties/Strength%20X%20Property.md) of their worn armor.
  * Only items with the [Armor X Property](../Items/Equipment/Individual%20Item%20Cards/Armors/Armor%20Properties/Armor%20X%20Property.md) are considered worn armor.

A creature's speed is defined by their stat block and may or may not follow this rule. If unspecified, it is 25' + (5' x the creature's [Level](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md)).

*Good for gamers who enjoy the nitty gritty of positioning tactics on battle maps.*
