# Check

A check is made to resolve an uncertain situation with stakes. (Also known as a "roll").

A check is made by rolling a d20 and then add *twice* the relevant [Ability Score](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Ability%20Scores.md).

## Check Resolution

The check is successful if it meets or exceeds the difficulty class ([DC](DC.md)) of the target. Otherwise, the check is considered a failure.

## Contested Check

A contested check is made by doing the following:

The active creature makes an ability [Check](Check.md), with a [DC](DC.md) equal to the target's ability [Check](Check.md).

## Critical Rolls

A result of 20 (natural 20) is a [Critical Success](Dice%20Rolls/Critical%20Success.md).

A result of 1 (natural 1) is a [Critical Failure](Dice%20Rolls/Critical%20Failure.md).

*The reason 20 is a success and 1 is a failure means that the result is always uncertain. Accordingly the referee should only call for a check when the outcome is uncertain, otherwise, just resolve the PCs request and move on.*
