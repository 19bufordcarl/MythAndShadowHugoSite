# Mundane Materials

\#Mundane is the default material for weapons, armor, and other items. 

It assumes some combination of steel, dense cloth or leather, and wood as the components for the weapon. For short, this is simply referred to as mundane.

Some creatures can only be harmed by [Silvered](Silvered%20Property.md) or [Mythril](Mythril%20Property.md) weapons.
