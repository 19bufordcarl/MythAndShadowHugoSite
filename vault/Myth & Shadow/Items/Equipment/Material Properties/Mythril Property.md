# Mythril Materials

Mythril [Weapons](../Weapons.md), [Armor](../Armor.md), and [Ammo](../Individual%20Item%20Cards/Weapons/Weapon%20Properties/Ammo%20Property.md) can hold the strongest [Enchantments](../../../Magic/Enchanting/Enchanting.md).

## Mythril Weapons

\#Mythril means that the weapon deals an additional +2 damage. 

Mythril [Weapons](../Weapons.md) must be constructed from scratch.

* The weapon has the same properties, except replace [Mundane](Mundane%20Property.md) with [Mythril](Mythril%20Property.md).
* The weapon takes up 1 less [Item Slot](../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Item%20Slots.md) (minimum of 1).
* Weapons with the [Ranged Property](../Individual%20Item%20Cards/Weapons/Weapon%20Properties/Ranged%20Property.md) do not benefit from increased damage.
  * You must use Mythril [Ammo](../Individual%20Item%20Cards/Weapons/Weapon%20Properties/Ammo%20Property.md) to get a ranged damage benefit.

Some creatures can only be harmed by [Mythril](Mythril%20Property.md) weapons.
