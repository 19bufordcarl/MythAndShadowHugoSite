# Torch

When lit on fire, it illuminates out for 30 feet. 

* Lighting a torch requires 1 [Action](../../../../../Game%20Procedures/Action.md).
  * Needs a [Tinderbox](../10%20Coins/Tinderbox.md) to ignite.
* The light lasts for 1 hour.

Three torches of materials is enough for an 8 hour campfire instead, suitable for a [Long Rest](../../../../../Game%20Procedures/Resting.md#Long%20Rest).
