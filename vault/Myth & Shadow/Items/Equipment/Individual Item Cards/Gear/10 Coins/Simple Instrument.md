# Simple Instrument

Let's the wielder make a [Charisma](../../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Charisma.md) [Check](../../../../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) with [Disadvantage](../../../../../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Disadvantage.md) to amuse listeners.

* There is no standard benefit to this, though some creatures and NPCs like music.

Examples include a wooden flute, a bell, etc.
