# Fetters

Metal shackles that can be used to [Restrain](../../../../../Conditions/Restrained.md) a willing or [Incapacitated](../../../../../Conditions/Incapacitated.md) creature to the floor.

* If the fetters are not attached to a structure, the movement restriction on the [Restrained](../../../../../Conditions/Restrained.md) condition imposed only halves the creature's [Movement](../../../../../Game%20Procedures/Movement.md) speed rather than reducing it to 0.
