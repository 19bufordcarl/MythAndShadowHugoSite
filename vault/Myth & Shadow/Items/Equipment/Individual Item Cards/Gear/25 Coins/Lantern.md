# Lantern

When the oil is lit, it illuminates out for 60 feet. 

* Lighting a lantern requires 1 [Action](../../../../../Game%20Procedures/Action.md).
  * Needs a [Tinderbox](../10%20Coins/Tinderbox.md) to ignite.
* Consumes one [Oil Vial](../10%20Coins/Oil%20Vial.md) per hour of light.

Lanterns have a shutter that can be used to hide its light without extinguishing it.
