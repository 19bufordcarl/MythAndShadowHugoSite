# Armor X

\#ArmorX is the main property of all [Armor](../../../Armor.md) sets.
When you would take [Slashing](../../../../../Damage%20Types/Slashing.md), [Piercing](../../../../../Damage%20Types/Piercing.md), or [Bludgeoning](../../../../../Damage%20Types/Bludgeoning.md) damage, you reduce the damage from that type by X. 

**Worn armor does not take up any [Item Slots](../../../../../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Item%20Slots.md).**

You can replace pieces of an armor set with magic items, winged boots for example, without affecting the [Armor X Property](Armor%20X%20Property.md) unless the item states otherwise.

### Don / Doff

Normal Armor takes 1 minute (10 combat [Rounds](../../../../../Game%20Procedures/Round.md)) to don / doff.
