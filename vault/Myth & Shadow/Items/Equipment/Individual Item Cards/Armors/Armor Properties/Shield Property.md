# Shield

\#Shield is the main property of all shields.
Shields require a one free hand to wield.
Shields grant the bearer the Shield Block ability.

#### Shield Block

Shield Block is a [Reaction](../../../../../Game%20Procedures/Reaction.md). 

You may use this reaction after an [Attack](../../../../../Game%20Procedures/Attack.md) against you is made, but before damage is rolled. 

You attempt to block the [Attack's](../../../../../Game%20Procedures/Attack.md) [Bludgeoning](../../../../../Damage%20Types/Bludgeoning.md), [Piercing](../../../../../Damage%20Types/Piercing.md), or [Slashing](../../../../../Damage%20Types/Slashing.md) damage.

* Make a [Strength](../../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md) [Check](../../../../../Game%20Procedures/Check.md) with a [DC](../../../../../Game%20Procedures/DC.md) equal to the target's [Attack](../../../../../Game%20Procedures/Attack.md) roll.

* On a successful block, the shield bearer adds 1 to their [Armor X Property](Armor%20X%20Property.md) for the calculation of this attack's damage. If the bearer is unarmored, treat X as 0.

* On a failure, damage proceeds as normal.

(Reminder that [Reactions](../../../../../Game%20Procedures/Reaction.md) can only be used once per [Round](../../../../../Game%20Procedures/Round.md)).
