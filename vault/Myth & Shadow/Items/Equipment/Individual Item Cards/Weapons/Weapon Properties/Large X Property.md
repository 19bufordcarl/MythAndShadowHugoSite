# Large X

\#LargeX means that you attack with [Disadvantage](../../../../../Game%20Procedures/Dice%20Rolls/Disadvantage.md) unless you have X [Strength](../../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md).

When you succeed on an [Attack](../../../../../Game%20Procedures/Attack.md), roll double the damage dice and use the highest result(s).

*The heavy weight of these weapons decreases the variability of their damage.*
