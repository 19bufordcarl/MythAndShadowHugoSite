# Ranged

\#Ranged means the weapon can be used to make [Ranged Attacks](../../../../../Game%20Procedures/Ranged%20Attack.md) with its specified range.
[Ranged Attacks](../../../../../Game%20Procedures/Ranged%20Attack.md) can only deal [Piercing](../../../../../Damage%20Types/Piercing.md) damage by default.

Most ranged weapons require [Ammo](Ammo%20Property.md) as well.

You can reload a ranged weapon with ammo as part of your [Attack](../../../../../Game%20Procedures/Attack.md).
