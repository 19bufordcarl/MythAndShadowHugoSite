# Ammo

\#Ammo means that the weapon needs a type of ammunition in order to make an [Attack](../../../../../Game%20Procedures/Attack.md).

Each attack consumes 1 instance of that ammunition. 

You can pick up one piece of used ammunition with an [Action](../../../../../Game%20Procedures/Action.md).

The 3 main types of ammo are [Arrow](../Ammo/Arrow.md), [Bolt](../Ammo/Bolt.md), and [Sling Stone](../Ammo/Sling%20Stone.md).
