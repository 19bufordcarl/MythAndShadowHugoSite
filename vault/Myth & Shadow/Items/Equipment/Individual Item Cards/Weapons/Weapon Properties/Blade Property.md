# Blade

\#Blade means that the weapon can be used for [Slashing](../../../../../Damage%20Types/Slashing.md) or [Piercing](../../../../../Damage%20Types/Piercing.md) damage.

The pommel can still be used for 1 + [Strength](../../../../../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Strength.md) [Bludgeoning](../../../../../Damage%20Types/Bludgeoning.md) damage.
