# Dual Wield

\#DualWield means that you can wield this weapon in your off hand. 

When you succeed on an [Attack](../../../../../Game%20Procedures/Attack.md),

1. Roll the damage dice for both weapons
1. Determine which weapon did less damage for that roll
1. Double that lower result to get the final damage die result

*Dual wielding is tough to execute, but has much more potential for damage.*
