* [ ] Assign [Ability Scores](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Ability%20Scores.md) from one of the following methods:
  * [ ] Assign a value to each of the scores between -3 and +3. The total of all your abilities must be equal to 0. Good for heroic campaigns with specific character concepts.
  * [ ] Assign a +1 to 3 ability scores manually or randomly. The same one can be chosen multiple times. Good for simplicity and new players.
  * [ ] Use the [Old School Ability Generation](Old%20School%20Ability%20Generation.md) method for each ability. Good for old school gamers, or those who like the randomness to spark creativity and stories.
* [ ] Calculate and mark down your derived statistics:
  * [ ] [AC](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Armor%20Class.md) = 2 x [Dexterity](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Dexterity.md)
  * [ ] [Experience Points](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Experience%20Points.md) = 0
  * [ ] [Fatigue Points](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Fatigue%20Points.md) = 1 + (2 x [Constitution](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md))
  * [ ] [Health Points](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Health%20Points.md) = 10 + [Constitution](../Player%20Characters/Chosen%20Statistics/Constitution.md)
  * [ ] [Level](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Level.md) = 1
  * [ ] [Scars](../Player%20Characters/Derived%20Statistics/Scars.md) = 0
